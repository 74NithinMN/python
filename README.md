The system is designed with a modular structure, offering distinct functionality for user authentication, managing student records, adding and viewing activities, and uploading/viewing photos. The program ensures smooth navigation between pages like login, sign-up, and dashboard, and offers a responsive user interface with a focus on ease of use and accessibility.
